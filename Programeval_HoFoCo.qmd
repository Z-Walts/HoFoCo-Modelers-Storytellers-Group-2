## Hollywood coalition data cleaning and analysis.

This file contains the data cleaning and data analysis for Hollywood Food Coalition an organization aimimg to reduce food insecurity in Los Angeles.

# Load and Prepare the Data

Use read_excel to load data, after removing encryption in excel and rename new file to HFC_2025. For password openxlsx does not work despite having the password option.

```{r}
#| echo: true
HFC_2025 <- read_excel("HFC_2025.xlsx")
View(HFC_2025)

names(HFC_2025) #list of all the variables within the spreadsheet
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Total unique individuals served weekly
summary(HFC_2025$'Unique individuals served weekly')

# Total individuals served monthly
summary(HFC_2025$'Unique individuals served monthly')

```

The variable names contain spaces hence will need to be cleaned using the janitor package creating a new data set HFC_2025_clean.

```{r clean_variables}

HFC_2025_clean <- clean_names(HFC_2025)

# View column names to check
names(HFC_2025_clean)



```

We can see a summary of the individuals served weekly and monthly.

```{r service_volume}
#| echo: true

summary(HFC_2025_clean$unique_individuals_served_weekly)
summary(HFC_2025_clean$total_served_weekly)

On average, 6.1% of individuals served across all organizations are under 18. Around 17.2% of individuals are young adults (18–25). About 32.5% are adults aged 26–40. About 32.5% are middle-aged to older adults (41–65). Around 12.6% are seniors, aged 65 and above.

```{r gender_summary}

About 54.3% of the individuals served are male.About 41.5% are female.About 2.2% are non-binary. About 5.6% identify as transgender (can overlap with other categories depending on how the data was reported). The following plot shows gender distribution across all partners.

# Cleaning and plottin race

Race contains mixed data that is string and numeric we might need to separate it using the following code.

```{r cleaning_formatting_race}


# View unique entries to understand formatting
unique(HFC_2025_clean$racial_makeup_of_population_served)


# Extract percent-race pairs from raw race string
race_cleaned <- HFC_2025_clean %>%

         race_raw = str_replace_all(race_raw, "armenian|arab|armenianrussian|filipino|korean|colombian|salvadorian|venezulian", "other"),

```

Important to note not all organizations include the percent of racial makeup they just list the races. The following plot assesses data which contains % makeup of the 38 out of the total 42 organizations without missing data. Filipino, Russian, Armenian and other country specific were set to other for now hence the large percent of other.

```{r plot_race}
#| echo: true
race_summary <- race_long %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(mean_pct = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(race_summary, aes(x = reorder(group, -mean_pct), y = mean_pct, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = "Average Racial Composition Across Organizations",
       y = "Mean % Served", x = "Race") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r race_plot_each_org}
ggplot(race_long, aes(x = org_id, y = group, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = "Racial Composition per Organization",
       x = "Organization", y = "Race Group", fill = "% Served") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This visualization highlights how racial representation varies by organization. While Latinx and Black communities are consistently represented, some organizations show a near-exclusive service to one group. This racial composition is important for understanding equity in food access and can inform tailored programming and outreach. Notably, Asian and 'Other' populations appear less frequently, which could suggest either demographic realities or potential service gaps. Also not all organizations iclude percent of people affected.

# Qualitative Impact

Utilising word cloud to view impact.The default stopwords("en") removes general English filler words (like "the", "is", "it"). But our text still contains domain-irrelevant or generic words like: guys, week, kids, know, one, used, get, great, makes, just, able, come, etc.

The most frequent words include:

“food”, “people”, “give”, “quality”, “produce”, “relief”, “nutritious”, “kitchen”, “residents”, “parents”, “love”

The word ‘food’ dominates the stories — underscoring its centrality to service impact.

‘Relief’, ‘quality’, and ‘produce’ point to the value and trust recipients associate with the program.

References to ‘residents’, ‘parents’, and ‘love’ highlight emotional and familial dimensions of food insecurity.

# We can go further and create themes based on the words.

For this I chose nutrition, community, empowerment, distribution, emotion.

```{r creating_themes_for word}

Note we can go further and do topic modelling but will leave it at themes for now.

# Organization value and resilience

```

Nearly half of the organizations that HoFoCo works with with are volunteer-run, highlighting a strong reliance on community-driven labor. However, a slightly greater number operate with non-volunteer staffing structures. This suggests a mix of grassroots and institutional capacity within the partner network. The presence of missing values also points to potential opportunities to improve data collection clarity or completeness.”

## Text exploration

# Importance of HoFoCo

# Show top 10 terms per topic

topics %>%

  top_n(10, beta) %>%

```

Top 10 keywords: food, budget, purchase, increase, consistency, serve, quality, farmers based on probability values. Now to view all 97 in topics.

```{r}
#| echo: true

top_terms <- topics %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%

  scale_x_reordered() +
  labs(title = "Top Terms per LDA Topic",
       x = "Term", y = "Beta (Importance in Topic)")

```

Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified 3 major thematic clusters from open-text responses in the "hypothetical_food_response_without_hofoco" question:

Topic 1: Food Budgeting and Procurement Top terms: food, budget, purchase, consistency, increase, serve, resources, raise, distribute, continue This topic centers around how organizations plan for and manage food procurement, budgeting constraints, and ensuring consistent distribution.

We can label topic as "sustaining Food Supply through Budgeting and Purchasing"

Topic 2: Partner Reliance and Community Coordination Top terms: food, resource, partners, pantry, community, figure, difficult, people This topic shows organizations’ dependence on partner networks, food pantries, and community coordination to address gaps. We can label it community Collaboration and External Resource Navigation

Topic 3: Urgency, Impact, and Emotional Strain Top terms: impact, source, spending, quantity, volume, tremendously, programs, participants, frustration, families, communicate This topic addresses the the emotional and operational impact of food insecurity and limited resources — particularly on participants and families. We can label it emotional and Operational Impact of Insecurity on Families

Note we can do more than 3 themes but for the purpose of presentation I just selected 3.
